## Quick Start: The workflow of scoopa

Scoopa is build to have a huge impact on the day-to-day work at broadcasters, media companies, production houses, event organizers, TV rights distributors and marketing firms. Wherever high-resolution videos need to be transferred from A to B, C, D. Wherever people located on another place on the globe need access 365/7/24 – as fast as possible, as easy as possible but still for a very competitive budget!

We from scoopa believe that it is best to send video content – e.g. the “master-copy” - only ONCE into the cloud. Just one upload for ALL TIME. An upload needs resources: an internet connection, huge bandwidth, time and someone to manage. Why doing this more than once? If you follow this workflow idea you can “send” largest files from your mobile phone. You just need to give access to a file and do not have to upload it again. This is 2017…

If it is uploaded you have the following advantages:
* Your content is in a safe place: three live backups, fully redundant power, aircondition. Strictest safety rules… Your content is stored in the most reliable place!
* Your content is always available – for anyone who has permission and from anywhere. You just need to decide who is allowed to preview and/or download. No search for the hard disk anymore… “Oh – this content is on the hard drive we gave Peter. There was a lot free storage and we thought he can use this one…”.
* There is no physical hard drive anymore that could get lost.
* You have a low-resolution version online (scoopa is transcoding to h.264 automatically for preview).
* You can associate text, copyright rules, keywords & tags searchable from everyone.

### 2. Step: Decide about the web address (URL) of your scoopa platform! 

This page will be a sub-domain to the scoopa website:
e.g. abc-company.scoopa.com OR mediapool-xy-name-of-event.scoopa.com etc.

![(KB_pic3.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic3.png)


### 3. Step: Your contact details

Please tell us the name of your company as well as your first and last name and click the boxes for accepting our “Terms of Service” (Link), “Service Level Agreement” (Link) “Privacy Policy” (Link) and press “Sign Up”.

![(KB_pic4.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic4.png)
 
 
It’s done. To finish setup, check your emails and set your password.

![(KB_pic5.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic5.png)
 

### 4. Step: Verify your email address

You receive an automated email-notification “Almost Done!” from no-reply@mailer.scoopa.com in your inbox. 

**If you do not receive this email please check your spam folder!**

Please click the blue button “Set Password” in the email.

If you’re having trouble clicking the "Set Password" button, copy and paste the URL below into your web browser:
 
![(KB_pic6.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic6.png)
 

### 5. Step: Choose your password 

Important: Use at least 8 characters, upper & lowercase letters & one number.

![(KB_pic7.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic7.png)

Whoop! Whoop! It’s already done – you’ve setup your own highspeed cloud platform!

### 6. Step: Platform Settings

Welcome to your scoopa platform!

Now you can notice your domain-name in the browser, which is your chosen name (here: my.scoopa.com).

Note: Wouldn’t it be nice if the platform refers to your company’s branding and corporate identity? We offer a custom branding (background, logos, claims) as option. Please contact us at contact@scoopa.com.

![(KB_pic8.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic8.png)

The dashboard helps you to personalize your platform. 

Note: You should complete those steps immediately as this process asks for needed data for the email notifications to admins and users of your platform!

Press the first red button “Do it now” to set a platform name for your event or company. 

The following page opens:
 
![(KB_pic9.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic9.png)

Fill in the fields as required. 

“Contact Name”, “Contact E-mail“ and “Contact Phone” should be the person who is going to answer questions from your users regarding your content.

As “Custom Link in Footer” you can enter the URL of your companies homepage. With “Custom Link Name in Footer” you can just give it another name to appear in the footer of your platform (e.g. “scoopa homepage” for http://www.scoopa.com). Click “Save”!

![(KB_pic10.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic10.png)

![(KB_pic11.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic11.png)

Green light – your scoopa platform is fully operational!

 
<a name="create-users"></a>
## How to create users

This is the first step: Build your list of people called “users” you want to send or share files with.

Go to the “Users” tab in the menu. Click the blue button “Add User”.

![(KB_pic12.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic12.png)
 
The “Add User” form opens. Fill in the requested information about the user. 

![(KB_pic13.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic13.png)

When your are finished, choose the “role” of the user:

The levels are

**Admin**   
An Administrator is allowed to manage the platform: organize folder structure, create users, set read rights.

**User**   
A User is invited by an admin. Access only to associated folders/files. Can download high-res and low-res files as well as watch previews. You can have users as “uploaders” in dedicated Folders.

**Guest**   
A Guest is invited by an admin. Access only to associated folders/files. Only allowed to watch previews in browser.


You can also decide if

* this user should always receive notification emails. 
* this user should be allowed to edit his profile.
* this user should have a “mailbox” to upload.

Click “Save”.
 
The User receives an automated email-notification “Welcome!”. 

![(KB_pic14.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic14.png)

The user needs to set his password by clicking the blue button in the email.
Important: at least 8 characters, upper & lowercase letters, one number

![(KB_pic15.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic15.png)

This list in the user section is only visible to admin-level. It is your global directory of your users (in fact your co-workers, suppliers and clients).

![(KB_pic16.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic16.png)

IMPORTANT: The new registered user will only have access to folders you gave allowance to by checking the box (see “How to create and manage files”).


Move your mouse over a user. It highlights the user and two options appear on the right:

* Edit
* Move to trash

![(KB_pic17.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic17.png)

Click the user. The “Edit User” window opens: 

![(KB_pic18.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic18.png)

You can change the settings, the “role” and you can send a new password (if the user lost his own password). 

Scroll down the page:

Here is the area where you can bring users and folders together. Here you can manage the read and download rights of your users. 

![(KB_pic19.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic19.png)

**Associated folders**

With a tick in the box next to the folder you give this user access to a specific folder in the left column “Associated Users”. 

**Uploaders for folders**

If you want to give this user allowance to upload content in this folder you can do it in the right column.

**History**

In the last areas you can see when a user last logged into the platform as well as a report about the actions of the user per file such as preview (named “Play”) or downloads.

Make sure you press “Save” once finished.

 


<a name="manage-folders"></a>
## How to create and manage files

In the “Files” section you manage and structure your content. You can create folders and manage their rights.

![(KB_pic20.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic20.png)

Press the Button “Add Folder” on the top of the page. The following page appears:

![(KB_pic21.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic21.png)

Give your folder a name and press “Save”. You can also decide if this folder should send “Notification-Emails” – what is that?

Note: You can have as many sub-folders of folders as you like to structure and manage your content. For a better overview it might be clever to name them YYYY-MM-DD-XYZ to have them lined.

**Watchfolder**
If you mark a folder to send “Notification-Emails” the folder will automatically send emails to all associated users once a file is uploaded. 

Note: If you run an event and want to deliver for example news or highlights as fast as possible you should create the folders and the files before the event happens (yes – without the content). Manage the rights for your users with the checkboxes. If you do so the system will send the notifications to the users automatically in the moment someone uploads the content! This means that you do not need to oversee and check the process of delivery during the event. The producer / editor needs to know in which folder to upload the content and all the rest is done by scoopa! Because you did your homework upfront…
 
How to work with a “Folder”

Inside your folder you have the following options:

* Edit
* Move to Trash
* Add File
* Add Folder

![(KB_pic22.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic22.png)

Press “Edit” and you can enter text in the white fields.

* You can change the folder’s name
* You can add text as description of the content
* You can add text with information to copyright restrictions

Note: These fields are visible to all users with access to this folder.

Make sure you press “Save” once finished.

![(KB_pic23.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic23.png)
 
Scroll down and two lists with checkboxes and your users appear:
In the left column you can give users the read or download rights (depending on their role).
In the right column you can allow a user to upload content into this folder.

Example: Your content is produced by a 3rd party media house and you don’t want to give the full Admin rights to the editor. In this case you create a folder and check the box with associated users (who will receive the notification email and have access to the folder). 
The editor needs to be registered as a user as well. Now check the box of the editor in the right column and he is allowed to upload the content into this folder.

![(KB_pic24.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic24.png)
 
If you press “Move to Trash” you will delete the folder. (Link zu Trash)

![(KB_pic25.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic25.png)


 
<a name="manage-files"></a>
## How to add a file

A file in scoopa is a “container” for a video-file or other content. 

Press “Add File” – even if you do not want to upload the content now.

If you want to use the original file name, just click “Choose File(s)”. If you want to rename the filed inside scoopa you can enter the new name. 

You do not need to upload now. If you just want to prepare a file and associate users but do not have the content available yet (or do not want to publish) click “ Save & Upload later”.

If the content is ready for upload click “Choose File(s)”
 
![(KB_pic26.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic26.png)

Note: The philosophy of scoopa follows the idea to name and structure your files by the content – not by the destination or your users!

If you do it like recommended, your content needs to be uploaded only once! In a second step, you can manage who will be allowed to see and download the content with “Rights” (this is the allowance to read and download per file). 

So never create a folder e.g. “news for BBC” but better e.g. “2016-09-25_Berlin Marathon_Broadcast News_english VO”. Then you only tick a box next to the user you want to give rights.

Upload your content as high-resolution in broadcast quality. Scoopa creates the low resolution preview (also ready for download) automatically! All known codecs are possible. The low-res is H.264. 

Double-click on the file on your desktop or mark several files if you want to upload more than one file.

![(KB_pic27.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic27.png)

![(KB_pic28.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic28.png)

The file is uploading to the data centre. If you want to manage other users, folders or files you can click “Continue in new tab” to proceed. 

**DON’T CLOSE THIS TAP IN YOUR BROWSER, AS THAT ACTION WILL STOP THE UPLOAD.**

![(KB_pic29.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic29.png)

If you upload several files at the same time you will see a different window:
 
![(KB_pic30.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic30.png)

The uploaded files will appear immediately in the dedicated folder:

![(KB_pic31.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic31.png)

Move your mouse over a file. It highlights the file and three options appear on the right:

* Download
* Edit
* Move to Trash
 
![(KB_pic32.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic32.png)

Click on a file. 

This is the window with the video asset. The video preview is generated by scoopa automatically. It is a low-resolution video h.264 for the web viewer. 

There are two blue download buttons:

* “Download” (your file exactly as uploaded)
* “Download Preview” (the lower resolution video from the web viewer)

![(KB_pic33.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic33.png)

Scroll down. Below the web player you can see the “Analytics” - the history of actions logged for this folder.
 
In “Edit File” you can change the filename and add a description or copyright text. 
You can add content keywords as well as tags. These fields are searchable.

![(KB_pic34.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic34.png)

Keywords & Tags appear in the asset overview:
You can search for keywords and tags via the global search. The search function is located in the header of the platform. This is a powerful tool to find content as fast as possible.
 
![(KB_pic35.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic35.png)

Press the button “Show Asset Details” and you will see all technical metadata around your uploaded video file. These are automatically generated during upload.

Note: During the upload scoopa is doing a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). This is an error-detecting code. If the video file appears as preview it is checked and the asset is exactly the same file as it was on the hard disc of the uploader.

![(KB_pic36.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic36.png)
 
<a name="admin"></a>
## Manage your platform as Admin

Scoopa has two main areas to operate and get things done:

* Files
* Users

There are also the areas

* Dashboard
* Trash
* Settings

for administration.

You can navigate to these areas on the left side of your platform.

![(KB_pic37.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic37.png) 

If you are Owner or Admin of the platform you can see your contract details in “Settings” / “Subscription”.

![(KB_pic38.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic38.png) 
 

**Move Files**

If you want to move a file to another folder press “move” and choose another target folder as the new home of the content. Press “Move File” and the file appears in the new folder.

![(KB_pic39.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic39.png) 
 
**Trash**

In “Trash” you can find your deleted files. All “deleted” files are still save and stored for another 7 days within your trash. You can restore the files in this period. After this time the content in “Trash” will be finally deleted.

![(KB_pic40.png)](https://github.com/bestboysmedialab/scoopa-docs/raw/master/ressources/KB_pic40.png) 
 
<a name="file-organisation"></a>
## A short Guido to file organisation

In the files section you can manage your content and create and edit your folders. 
The storage in scoopa organizes content exactly the same way as your hard disk on your computer does.

Think about organizing your files section by clever naming (e.g. Year-month-Date_Event_Content) and sorting by folders. If you have a large amount of folders you will see that it’s worth to invest some minutes to think about a structure. Sometimes clients sort like this:


    2016-09-24
      Inline-Marathon
        Trailer
        Live Recording
        News
        Rough Cut
        Highlights Show
    2016-09-25
      Marathon
        Trailer
        Live Recording
        News
        Rough Cut
        Highlights Show
	
	
With this structure you can easily handle the rights of your clients for the content (Who bought which content? Who should get access to which broadcast products?)

Scoopa works with the philosophy to have all folders and files as “watchfolders”. That means you create empty storage and tell the platform what it has to do when the content once is uploaded. (For example: This news item should be send to your client a, b, c but not to d, e, f.)

Note: A User or Guest can only see the folders, files and content he is associated with by Admin. Other folders and files ARE NOT visible to them.
 
Reporting: Do I have feedback of who has downloaded the content?

Scoopa logs every visit and download by user or by content. Just go to the User-Edit page or into FILE page and scroll to the end of the page. Here you can see all logins and actions by user with timestamp.


**Lessons Learned:**

Some other clients made already good explorations using scoopa as effective as possible:

If you use scoopa around a specific sports event:
* Upload a shot list for your content as word, excel or pdf-document into the same folder – this makes it easier for producers!
* Upload result lists and any other related content (press article) into the same folder.
* Upload a picture for web use into the folder – websites often use one of the first frames as pic of the video – that’s maybe not the best pic to get attention from the users of the webpage!
* If you’re running an event: create an extra folder with general information & content – photos, the press kit, starter-lists, etc. Your broadcasters or digital-platforms may do cross-promotion or marketing upfront for your product…
* If you have live taker on your event: Make videos as “city profile”, “course animation”, trailers etc. available to them via scoopa. They will appreciate this service.

## Index


**Admin**    
 Abbreviation for “administrator”. A user who is allowed to manage the platform (organizing folder structures, creating users, setting read rights)

**Codec**   
 … All known codecs are possible! The low-res is H.264.

**File**   
A File is a “container” for a content-asset, e.g. a video file

**Guest**   
A user invited by an admin. Has access only to associated folders/files and allowance to watch previews in browsers. A guest is not allowed to download.

**History**   
Listing of last loggings of users and report of all actions. History is available per user and per file. 

**Folder**   
Directory for saving files for better overview. You can have an unlimited number of folders. Each folder can have any number of sub-folders.

**Preview**    
Every uploaded video file is available as a preview in the web browser. Therefore scoopa renders a low-resolution version automatically. All known codecs are possible. The Preview is h.264.

**Trash**   
Storage for deleted files. All “deleted” files are still save and stored for another 7 days within your trash. You can restore the files in this period. After this time the content in “Trash” will be finally deleted.
