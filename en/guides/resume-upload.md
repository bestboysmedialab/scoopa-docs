Resuming an upload
=================

## Description

There are several possible scenarios where you need (or whish) to resume an upload.

That includes:

* Interrupted Line
* Computer or Browser-Crash
* Need for a relocation of the uploading-computer
* Pausing the upload and closing the Browser

## Usage

Resuming an upload is as easy as a normal upload.

Just reestablish your internet connection, go to your dedicated scoopa upload folder, click on add file again and the upload starts at the same position where it was interrupted.
(Due to unfinished chunks - the resumed position can vary)
